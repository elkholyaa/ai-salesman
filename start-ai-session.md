Below is a detailed summary of our session that you can use as background context for starting a new session:

---

**Project Overview:**

- **Project Name:** AI Salesman PoC  
- **Purpose:**  
  Develop a proof-of-concept AI chatbot for a mobile eâ€‘shop. The chatbot simulates interactive explanations for mobile phone specs and is built using Next.js (version 15.1.7), React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Technical Stack & Tools:**  
  - **Next.js (15.1.7)** with the Pages Router (and Turbopack for development).  
  - **React & TypeScript:** Used for UI components and ensuring type safety.  
  - **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid, responsive styling.  
  - **uuid:** For generating unique IDs.  
  - **Git:** For version control and pushing the project to a repository.

---

**File Structure & Setup:**

- **Initial Setup:**  
  We created a project with directories such as `components`, `config`, `hooks`, `pages`, `public`, `styles`, and `types`.  
- **Routing Conflict:**  
  The project originally had both an `app/` folder (App Router) and a `pages/` folder (Pages Router), which caused a conflict on the root path `/`.  
- **Resolution:**  
  - The decision was made to remove the `app/` folder entirely to use the Pages Router exclusively.  
  - Global CSS originally in `app/globals.css` was moved to a new folder (`styles/globals.css`).
  - A custom `_app.tsx` file was created under `pages/` to import global CSS and wrap every page.

---

**Code Adjustments & Error Fixes:**

- **TypeScript Errors in `_app.tsx`:**  
  - Initially, the `Component` and `pageProps` parameters lacked explicit types.  
  - We fixed this by importing `AppProps` from `next/app` and adjusting the return type to `React.ReactElement` (after also ensuring `React` was imported so that the JSX namespace was available).
  
- **Next.js Link Error:**  
  - An error occurred due to the new Next.js behavior regarding the `<Link>` component having an extra `<a>` child.  
  - We resolved this by removing the nested `<a>` tag in `pages/index.tsx` and applying the styling directly to the `<Link>` component (or alternatively, using the `legacyBehavior` prop).

---

**Documentation & Git Workflow:**

- **Documentation:**  
  A Markdown file (`PROJECT_DOC.md`) was created containing:
  - An overview of the project (objectives, tech stack, purpose).
  - A summary of the folder structure and roles of each major directory.
  - Instructions on setting up the project, running the development server, and how to use the Git workflow (staging, committing, and pushing changes).
  - Future enhancements and to-dos (such as integrating a real chatbot API, improving UI/UX, and adding tests).
  
- **Git Commands:**  
  - Use `git add .` to stage changes.
  - Commit with a descriptive message like `"Add project documentation and update project structure"`.
  - Push to the remote repository with `git push`.

---

**Current State:**

- The application now runs without routing conflicts.
- The chat window is visible and simulated responses are working.
- The project is documented, and the updated file structure is in place.
- Next steps include further testing, refining the UI/UX, integrating a live chatbot API in the future, and then deploying the application (for example, on Vercel).

This summary provides sufficient context to resume the project or start a new session with an understanding of the decisions made, the current structure, and the areas to focus on next.
