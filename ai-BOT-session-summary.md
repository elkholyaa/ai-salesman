### Session Summary (2025-02-22, 15:30)

**Work Completed:**

- **Chatbot UI Integration:**
  - **Created/Updated `components/Chatbot.tsx`:**  
    Implemented a floating chatbot window that opens automatically when a technical specification is selected. It now listens to the global ChatbotContext, sends an explanation request, and simulates a bot response.
  
- **Technical Specifications List:**
  - **Created `components/TechnicalSpecsList.tsx`:**  
    Developed a component that displays mobile technical specifications as a numbered list. Each spec includes an animated ðŸ¤– emoji trigger that, when clicked, sends the corresponding spec to the chatbot for explanation.

- **Global Context Integration:**
  - **Created `context/ChatbotContext.tsx`:**  
    Added a new context to manage the selected specification. This allows components like TechnicalSpecsList to update the context, triggering the Chatbot to provide an explanation.
  
- **Mobile Details Page Update:**
  - **Updated `pages/mobile-details.tsx`:**  
    Replaced the old SpecAccordion UI with the new TechnicalSpecsList component. Adjusted the onSpecSelect callback to update the global ChatbotContext with the selected specification.
  
- **App-Level Provider Configuration:**
  - **Updated `pages/_app.tsx`:**  
    Wrapped the app with both ChatHistoryProvider and ChatbotProvider, ensuring that the ChatbotContext is available throughout the application. This enables the floating chatbot UI to work on every page.

- **Code Clean-Up:**
  - **Removed `components/SpecAccordion.tsx`:**  
    Deleted the unused SpecAccordion file to maintain a clean codebase aligned with the new chatbot branch approach.

- **Commit & Push:**
  - Changes were committed with the message:  
    `"Implement Chatbot UI with ChatbotContext integration; update MobileDetailsPage to use TechnicalSpecsList; remove unused SpecAccordion"`  
  - The updates were pushed to the `bot` branch.

### Session Summary (2025-02-22, 16:15)

**Work Completed:**

- **Chatbot UI Enhancements:**
  - **Integrated Follow-Up Options:**  
    Created and integrated the `ExplanationOptions.tsx` component into the Chatbot UI. This provides interactive buttons ("More Details", "Simplified Explanation", "Compare with Other Tech") for follow-up requests.
  
  - **Enhanced Chatbot Component:**  
    Updated `components/Chatbot.tsx` to:
    - Listen for selected specifications via `ChatbotContext`.
    - Store the current spec context in a new state variable (`currentSpecContext`) for better follow-up handling.
    - Replace simulated responses with real API calls using the `useChat` hook.
    - Integrate follow-up option callbacks to include full spec context in subsequent explanation requests.

- **Custom Hook Integration:**
  - **Created `hooks/useChat.ts`:**  
    Implemented a custom hook to abstract the API call to the `/api/chat` endpoint. This hook now handles sending messages and retrieving AI-generated responses, which are used in the Chatbot component.

- **Technical Specs Interaction:**
  - **Updated `pages/mobile-details.tsx`:**  
    Modified the Mobile Details page to use the `TechnicalSpecsList` component, ensuring that clicking an emoji next to a specification updates the `ChatbotContext` and triggers the Chatbot to open with an explanation request.

- **Global Context Updates:**
  - **ChatbotContext and Providers:**  
    Confirmed that the entire app is wrapped with both `ChatHistoryProvider` and `ChatbotProvider` in `pages/_app.tsx`, ensuring that all components have access to the necessary global state.

- **Code Cleanliness and Commit:**
  - Removed the unused `SpecAccordion.tsx` file to keep the codebase clean.
  - Committed and pushed changes with the message:  
    *"Add ExplanationOptions integration in Chatbot UI with useChat hook for API calls and spec context storage for follow-ups"*

This summary can be used with your AI coding assistant to kick off the next session, ensuring continuity and clarity on the current state of the project.

### Session Summary (2025-02-22, 17:40)

**Work Completed:**

- **Chatbot UI Enhancements:**
  - **Auto Scroll-to-Bottom:**  
    Implemented a ref in the Chatbot component so that the messages container automatically scrolls to show the latest message when new messages arrive.
  
  - **Refined Animations:**  
    Added a fade-in animation for new chat messages to improve the visual polish and user experience.

- **Follow-Up Options Integration:**  
  - Integrated the ExplanationOptions component into the Chatbot UI, allowing users to request "More Details", "Simplified Explanation", or "Compare with Other Tech" for any specification.
  - Enhanced follow-up request handling by incorporating the stored specification context into API requests.

- **API Integration & Custom Hooks:**
  - Modified the useChat hook to use the centralized sendChatMessage function from the utils/api.ts module, ensuring all chatbot API calls are consistent and centralized.
  - Updated the API endpoint in `/api/chat` with robust error handling and input validation using the GPT-4o-mini model.

- **Component & Context Updates:**
  - Created and integrated the HoverTrigger component to encapsulate interactive emoji behavior (with tooltips and animations), and updated the TechnicalSpecsList to use it.
  - Developed the ChatMessage component to modularize the rendering of individual chat messages.
  - Ensured that the entire app is wrapped with both ChatHistoryProvider and ChatbotProvider for consistent global state management.

- **Code Cleanup:**
  - Removed the obsolete SpecAccordion component to maintain a clean, maintainable codebase.

This comprehensive update brings us to a key milestone in our Chatbot Branch POC, with a polished chatbot UI that automatically scrolls and animates new messages, offers interactive follow-up options, and integrates real API responses.
