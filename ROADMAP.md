# AI Salesman PoC Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the next steps and planned enhancements for the AI Salesman PoC project. Currently, we have a basic working chat interface with simulated bot responses and a modular file structure. The next phase focuses on enhancing the user journey by integrating interactive UI elements and dynamic chatbot interactions.

## Current Status
- **Core Chat Interface:**  
  The chat interface is operational, displaying conversation history and echoing user messages with simulated bot responses. This is implemented in `components/ChatInterface.tsx` using a custom hook (`hooks/useConversation.ts`).

- **Routing:**  
  Basic routing is established with a demo page (`pages/[demo]/chat.tsx`) that utilizes configurations from `config/demos.ts`.

- **Global Styling:**  
  Tailwind CSS is properly configured in `styles/globals.css` and applied across the application.

- **Project Structure:**  
  The codebase is modular and well-documented, with separate files for components, hooks, API routes, and type definitions.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Mobile Phone Details Page:**  
   - **Objective:** Create a dedicated page to display mobile phone details and technical specifications.
   - **Task:** Develop a new page (e.g., `pages/mobile-details.tsx`) that presents technical specs in a structured layout.

2. **Interactive Specification Accordions:**  
   - **Objective:** Implement expandable accordion sections for each technical specification.
   - **Task:** Build accordion UI components that reveal detailed specs upon expansion with smooth transitions.

3. **Dynamic Chatbot Explanations:**  
   - **Objective:** Integrate the chatbot to provide explanations dynamically when a specification section is expanded.
   - **Task:** Connect accordion expansions with simulated chatbot responses that detail the corresponding spec.

4. **Suggested Actions & User Input Options:**  
   - **Objective:** Enhance the interaction by offering follow-up suggestions (e.g., “more details”, “simplified explanation”, “tech comparisons”) and user input options.
   - **Task:** Implement UI elements that display suggested actions and capture custom user queries.

## Future Enhancements
- **Live Chatbot API Integration:**  
  Transition from simulated responses to live responses using an API (e.g., OpenAI) and consider utilizing Vercel’s AI SDK via the `useChat` hook.

- **UI/UX Refinements:**  
  Improve visual styling, responsiveness, and error handling across the application.

- **Testing & Deployment:**  
  Add unit and integration tests to ensure robust functionality, followed by deploying the final application using the Vercel CLI.

## Detailed Roadmap Tasks

### 1. Mobile Phone Details Page
- **Task:** Create a new page (e.g., `pages/mobile-details.tsx`) to display detailed mobile phone specifications.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Structure the page with sections for key specs.
  - Utilize Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern styling.
- **Outcome:** Users can view detailed technical information about the mobile phone.

### 2. Interactive Specification Accordions
- **Task:** Develop accordion components that allow users to expand/collapse individual technical specifications.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Use React state to manage the open/closed status of each accordion.
  - Include smooth transition animations for better user experience.
- **Outcome:** An interactive UI that lets users drill down into specific details at their own pace.

### 3. Dynamic Chatbot Explanations
- **Task:** Link accordion expansion events to trigger simulated chatbot explanations.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Upon expanding an accordion, the chatbot should automatically display a relevant explanation.
  - Continue using the simulated response approach until live integration is feasible.
- **Outcome:** Enhanced interactivity where users receive context-specific explanations tied to the technical specs.

### 4. Suggested Actions & User Inputs
- **Task:** Implement a feature to suggest follow-up actions and capture custom user inputs.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Present options such as “more details”, “simplified explanation”, or “tech comparison” within the chatbot interface.
  - Allow users to select a suggestion or type in a custom question.
- **Outcome:** Increased user engagement and a more guided, interactive experience.

### 5. Testing, Code Review, and Deployment
- **Task:** Ensure that all new components integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Conduct thorough code reviews to catch potential issues early.
  - Test the application locally using the Next.js development server.
  - Deploy the updated project using the Vercel CLI.
- **Outcome:** A robust, user-friendly application ready for live demonstration.

## Conclusion
This roadmap is designed to prioritize rapid development and a seamless user experience. By focusing on modular enhancements—starting with a dedicated details page, interactive accordions, dynamic chatbot explanations, and user input options—we ensure that the project remains both scalable and maintainable. Future enhancements will further integrate live API responses and refine the overall UI/UX.
